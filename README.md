# Heroes-of-Pymoli

<h2>DESCRIPTION OF OBSERVATIONS</h2>

<p><strong>1. Gender & Purchase:</strong></p>

<p>Although female players only accounted for one sixth of male players in quantity (81 vs. 484), they seemingly contributed slightly more than male players did in terms of “Average Purchase Price” ($3.20 vs. $3.02) and “Avg Total Purchase per Person” ($4.47 vs $4.07). However, they actually did not significantly purchase pricy items from a statistical point of view (see “Gender-related analysis (4)”). Statistically, there is no difference in purchasing behaviors between female and male.</p>

<p><strong>2. Age & Purchase:</strong></p>

<p>People in 20-24 years represented more than four tenth (44.79%) of those playing Pymoli. Together with those in 15-19 (18.58%) and 25-29 (13.37%), the percentile figure went up to three quarters. Impressively, 20-24 years old seemed to be the most active cohorts in this game. They never dropped out of top three for all tags we’ve analyzed (“Purchase Count”, “Average Purchase Price”, Total Purchase Value”, and “Avg Total Purchase per Person”). Depending on the distance from age 20-24, people exhibited different purchase patterns: High frequency (counts) is the key word for people close to 20-24 (age 15-19 and 25-29). They weighted on “Purchase Count”, and accumulatively on “Total Purchase Value”; On the other hand, those aging between 35-39 and less than 10 tended to spend more when purchasing items. They got highlighted in “Average Purchasing Price” and “Avg Total Purchase per Person”. The difference, however, was subtle and has been tested not to be of statistical significance (see “Age-related analysis (4)”). As a result, counts rather than item prices matter for age-related purchase: People in 20-24 almost made half of the purchase (47%) as well as contributed to almost half of the purchase value (47%).</p>

<p><strong>3. Item & Purchase:</strong></p>

<p>As seen in “Item-related analysis (3)”, of all purchases in Pymoli, 80% items (148 / 183) were purchased at least thrice; Around 40% items (77 /183) were bought at least five times; the figure sharply drop to roughly 10% for items purchased more than six times (23 / 183). However, only items purchased more than seven times are deemed to be profitable (greater than “Average Price” of $3.05). It suggests that the developers improve the popularity of pricy items to make profit.</p>
